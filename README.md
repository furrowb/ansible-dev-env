# Environment Setup

This playbook is my way to setup my personal development environment. In order to get started, first install ansible

```shell
# Arch/Manjaro
sudo pacman -S ansible
# Debian/Ubuntu - Not applicable yet
sudo apt-get install ansible
```

Once Ansible is installed, just use the following:

```shell
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```
